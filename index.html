        <h1>About me</h1>
        
        <p>I’m Patricia, principle and dog walker for Woofgang. I’ve been around animals all my life and after working as a graphic designer for most my professional career, my desire to be outside and foster my love for dogs was put into motion and Woofgang dog walking materialized. Health is very important to me and it ought to be for your dog. I’ll make sure your dog makes nice friends, gets a good workout and returns home happy and tired.
