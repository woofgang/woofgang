    <h1>How it all works</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span6">
        <h2>Service Agreement</h2>
        
        <p>I require all clients to sign a Service Agreement so that all polices and
        procedures are understood and agreed to as well as giving me permission to care for your dogand to enter your home.</p>

        <h2>Key Exchange for Dog Walking</h2>
        
        <p>I ask that clients give me a key at the initial interview. I am insured and bonded. I will keep your house key and entry codes in a secure location.</p>

        <h2>Pet Tag Identification &amp; Dog License</h2>
        
        <p>The best thing you can do for your pet is to have identification on them in case they get lost. I require that all dogs have identification with a name and phone number. If you are unable to provide a tag or if you will be unreachable during your trip I can provide one for you with my name and phone number as a contact. A dog license and micro chipping is also recommended.</p>
