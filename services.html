          <li><span>Contact Patricia (pmurino@hotmail.com) I’ll give you a call so we can chat on the phone 
            or over email about your dog’s basic personality and discuss walk details 
            (rates, where you live, your dog’s walk schedule).</span></li>
          <li><span>We set up a home visit (at no charge) to meet you and your dog, chat further, and fill out
            some paperwork. If all goes well…</span></li>
          <li><span>We set up your dog’s first walk. If it’s a good match, a basic contract is signed, and the
            adventure begins.</span></li>
